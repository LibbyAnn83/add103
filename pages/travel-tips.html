        <td>Always bring plenty of sunscreen. The sun at the beach can be strong, and sunscreen helps protect your skin from burns. Don't forget to reapply it throughout the day, especially after swimming. Itâ€™s smart to bring some aloe or after-sun lotion to soothe your skin if you get a little too much sun. Aloe helps cool and heal your skin fast.</td>

        <td>Bring lots of water to stay hydrated. It's easy to get thirsty in the sun and while being active. Having a cooler with drinks and snacks will keep you energized for all your beach adventures. Healthy snacks like fruit, nuts, or granola bars are great for kids and adults.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>What to Pack</td>
        <td><img src="../images/towels.png" alt="a stack of towels"></td>
        <td>Make sure you pack towels and umbrellas for shade. The beach can get hot, and an umbrella gives you a cool spot to rest. Towels are a must for drying off after swimming or lying on the sand. For families, pack extra clothes and toys for kids to keep them busy and comfortable. Small beach toys, hats, and sunscreen made just for kids are lifesavers. Don't forget to pack more than one swimsuit so you always have a dry one ready. Changing into a fresh suit feels great after a long day in the water. Finally, bring clothes that work for both the beach and a night out. Lightweight dresses, shorts, and casual shirts make it easy to go from sand to dinner without a hassle.
