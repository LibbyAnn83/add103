    <h3>McHenry County College - Crystal Lake, IL</h3>
<h3>Cataloging & Collection Development Librarian (2014-Present)</h3>
<h3>Library Department Chair (2017-Present)</h3>
<p>Since joining MCC in 2014, I've taken a leadership role in shaping the library's collections, services, and strategic direction. I work closely with faculty and staff across campus to align library resources with evolving academic needs. Through thoughtful analysis of usage data and gap assessments, I guide collection development and weeding efforts, ensuring the library remains relevant, student-centered, and responsive to curricular changes.</p>
<p>I led the library's migration from Voyager to Alma, mapping data, coordinating with CARLI, and training staff. As department chair, I oversee scheduling for 125-175 information literacy sessions each semester and facilitate team collaboration on instruction and outreach. I serve as administrator for Alma/Primo, OpenAthens, and LibApps.
Instruction is central to my role. I teach information literacy classes, support students and faculty via reference services, and develop LibGuides and instructional content tailored to specific courses. I've also taught LIB 110, our 1-credit info literacy course, and participated in program-level assessment.</p>
<p>I've pursued initiatives to improve accessibility and engagement, such as creating a family-friendly study space and updating our graphic novel collection through grant funding. During COVID, I quickly adapted services, including implementing Zoom consultations, redesigning our landing page, and refining instruction workflows to meet student needs remotely.</p>
<h3>Adjunct Reference Librarian (2008-2014)</h3>
<p>Provided research support and instruction, created LibGuides, and contributed to the core info literacy curriculum. I also participated in collection development and weeding efforts.</p>

<h3>UOP, LLC -- Des Plaines, IL</h3>
<h3>Librarian - Knowledge Management (2006-2013)</h3>
<p>At UOP, I collaborated across departments to build a more cohesive knowledge-sharing culture. I developed a taxonomy for technical documentation, created a searchable repository of 20,000 research reports, and co-designed a one-day course on knowledge sharing. I maintained and expanded catalog records for thousands of physical and digital resources and served as administrator for the Inmagic catalog, Documentum, LMS, and archives systems.</p>
<p>I revised retention schedules, supported internal audits, and led records and metadata projects with a focus on usability and long-term access. My work was grounded in both KMPro and Six Sigma Green Belt certification practices.</p>
