            <p>With over 25 years of experience working across public, special, and academic libraries—and more than 15 years specifically in academic settings—I bring a deep and well-rounded understanding of library services, operations, and leadership. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work in nearly every area of the library, from circulation and technical services to reference and instruction. I have also worked in youth services with children birth - 8th grade as well as with scientists and students. This broad base has allowed me to approach my work with both a practical mindset and a collaborative spirit.</p>
            <p>I'm an active, long-time member of the American Library Association's Library Leadership and Management Association, now known as CORE. Through this organization, I've contributed extensively to the development of library leadership competencies—researching best practices, participating in committee work, and helping shape how these competencies are applied in real-world library environments. I also have the privilege of serving as editor of Library Leadership & Management, one of CORE's flagship peer-reviewed journals, where I worked closely with contributors and reviewers to elevate and share impactful ideas in the profession.</p>
            <p>Leadership, to me, means guiding by example and lifting others along the way. I've served as a mentor to early-career librarians, led committees that supported both internal operations and professional development, and taken on department chair responsibilities to help strengthen team performance and morale. I'm passionate about the evolving role of libraries in our communities and thrive in environments that value innovation, integrity, and lifelong learning.</p>
            <p>Let's connect and talk about how I can bring this experience and energy to your team!</p>
