    <p><b>Hex Appeal</b> is the first book in the series <i>The Best Hex Ever</i>. Each book follows the story of a witch who tends to be a little (or a lot) unlucky in love. Hilarity ensues on the way to happily ever after. This first book focuses on the story of Essie Winterscale, a witch who has lived in the village of Good Winter for somewhere over 35 years (but she's not saying how many), and Josh Henderson, the new landlord.</p>

    <h2>Essie Winterscale</h2>

    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>Essie Winterscale is a witch who lives in Beldam House with her coven, and her mother <strong>Lilith</strong>. Witches age more slowly than normal humans, but Essie may have been born even earlier than anyone but her mother knew. Like 400 years earlier. Brought to the 20th century as a baby, Essie has only known the modern world and the ritual that brings the winter each year. Unfortunately her mother might not have been entirely truthful with her, and magic, time travel, and true love teach her about what it means to be a witch.</p>

    <p>Josh comes to Good Winter to escape his old life in Seattle. While he doesn't initially know his connection to Good Winter, as the story unfolds he discovers that his family was involved in witch hunts in the 1700s. While this caused some bumps in their path. Ultimately, it didn't keep Essie and Josh from happiness, leading Essie to say:</p>

    <q>Yeah?</q><br>
    <q>You're a witchfinder after all.</q><br>
