    <h1>Elizabeth's Introduction</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>I am taking ADD-103 this semester. I am taking this class in order to learn how to be better equipped to hand code in HTML. I can work well in a WYSIWYG environment, but I need to learn more in order to customize some of the options. I am also taking graphic design this summer.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Libraries</h3>

        <p>I have worked in libraries since I was 15. I started working part time in high school. When I went away to college I found a job at a local public library and worked my way up through page and clerk to a paraprofessional role. After I graduated I went right to library school to get my master's degree. Since then I have worked in corporate and academic libraries.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>

        <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, I also enjoy reading. When I was younger I always read above my grade level and that eventually translated into a love of reading. I prefer to read books in print so I can hold them and turn the pages. Reading a physical book is a very immersive experience. For convenience I also read eBooks, but it isn't my preference. I plan to get caught up on reading this summer!</p>
    <h3>Traveling</h3>

        <p>I also enjoy traveling with my family. Later this summer we will be taking a trip to the east coast. We have planned several different activities, including baseball games and hiking. The part of the trip I'm looking forward to the most is going to the beach. The sand, and the sun, and the sound of the waves on the beach is so relaxing and rejuvenating. When we get back I'll be ready to start a new semester.</p>
