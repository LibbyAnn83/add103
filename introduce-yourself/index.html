    <h2>Meet Elizabeth, Librarian and Lifelong Learner</h2>
    <p>Elizabeth has lived in Illinois her whole life and loves being part of her local community. She's a naturally curious person who enjoys reading, writing, hiking, and cooking. When she's not spending time with her three amazing kids, she's often learning something new. Right now, she's taking classes in graphic design and programming—and loving the challenge.</p>

    <p>She became a librarian because she enjoys helping people and making information easier to find. Over the years, she's worked in many different types of libraries—from public to college to special libraries—doing everything from shelving books to teaching research skills.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth earned a Master's degree in Library and Information Science from Dominican University and later earned a Master's in History from the University of Nebraska-Kearney. Even though she finished school years ago, she's never stopped learning. To her, learning is an adventure—full of questions to ask, ideas to explore, and skills to discover. She believes it's never too late to try something new.</p>

    <p>This message helps guide Elizabeth in her work and life, reminding her to be true to herself and support others in doing the same.</p>

    <p>Whether she's recommending a great book, answering a question, or exploring a new topic, Elizabeth brings curiosity, care, and creativity to everything she does.</p>
