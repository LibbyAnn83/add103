  <h2>Places I Love to Visit</h2>

  <p>Travel is one of my favorite ways to relax, explore, and learn new things. These are a few of the places I return to again and again—each one special in its own way.</p>


    <h3>Virginia Beach, Virginia</h3>
  <p>I love the beach because it's peaceful. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore helps me feel calm and clear-minded. Whether I'm walking along the sand, reading a book by the ocean, or just watching the sunset, Virginia Beach is the perfect place to unwind.</p>

   <h3>The Great Smoky Mountains</h3>
  <p>The Great Smoky Mountains National Park stretches across Tennessee and North Carolina. It's one of my favorite places to hike and spend time in nature. The trails are beautiful in every season, but I especially love visiting in the winter—it's usually warmer there than at home! The fresh mountain air and scenic views make it a great place to recharge.</p>

  <h3>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</h3>
  <p>Philadelphia is full of history, and that's what makes it such a fun place to visit. You can learn about Benjamin Franklin, visit Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, and feel like you're stepping back in time. And of course, no trip to Philly is complete without a cheesesteak. In my opinion, <strong>Geno's</strong> is the best spot to get one!</p>

  <p>Each of these places means something special to me, and I'm excited to share them with you through photos and stories. Keep exploring the page to see more!</p>
