  <h2>Cooking for a Family (and Learning to Love It)</h2>
  <p>With a family of five, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen—cooking, planning meals, and yes, doing a lot of cleaning up too! Over the past year and a half, I made a big change: I switched to a mostly vegan diet, and I’ve brought my family along for the ride. It’s been a learning experience, but also a really fun one.</p>

  <h3>Why I Enjoy Cooking</h3>
  <p>At first, cooking felt like a chore. But now I enjoy it for a few important reasons:</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li><strong>I know exactly what I’m eating</strong> – No mystery ingredients or surprise additives.</li>
    <li><strong>I can change recipes to fit my family’s needs</strong> – It’s easy to swap ingredients to fit everyone’s tastes and dietary needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegetables are actually really good</strong> – When they’re cooked the right way, they’re full of flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Eating at home saves money</strong> – We still get great meals, without the cost of eating out.</li>
    <li><strong>Leftovers are amazing</strong> – They make busy days so much easier.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Our Favorite Foods</h3>
  <p>Some of our favorite types of food are Chinese, Italian, and Mexican. The great news is that it’s totally possible to make delicious plant-based versions of all of them! Stir-fries, pastas, tacos, and more—there are so many options that use only plant-based ingredients and still taste great.</p>

  <h3>Trying New Things (and Getting Kids On Board)</h3>
  <p>My younger kids don’t always love trying new foods, but we’re getting there one meal at a time. My teenager, though, has been very open to this journey and has even given the thumbs-up to several of our go-to plant-based meals.</p>

  <p>Cooking for my family has become something I enjoy and even look forward to. I’m excited to keep exploring new recipes and sharing what I learn along the way!</p>
